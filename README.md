# A calculator
## What does it do?
Well, it calculates :D, just like a normal calculator... 



## ToDo 
-[] Annotate the source code
-[] Make source code even more modular
-[] Make it readable (less messy)
-[] More easter eggs?
-[] (Known Issue) Starting an equation with `(-)` operator doesn't work at all.
-[] (Known Issue) Program starts miscalculating if number is too large or too precised
-[] (Known Issue) Some (valid) results are way too precised.
-[] (Maybe) Add more operations
-[] (Maybe) Add other mathematical functions...
